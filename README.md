# Placeholders
Make placeholder views in your storyboard, add views or viewcontrollers later

#### Carthage

If you use [Carthage][] to manage your dependencies, simply add
Placeholders to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "NeedMoreDesu/Placeholder"
```

If you use Carthage to build your dependencies, make sure you have added `Placeholders.framework` to the "_Linked Frameworks and Libraries_" section of your target, and have included them in your Carthage framework copying build phase.

#### CocoaPods

If you use [CocoaPods][] to manage your dependencies, simply add
Placeholders to your `Podfile`:

```
pod 'Placeholders'
```
