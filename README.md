# Placeholders
Make placeholder views in your storyboard, add views or viewcontrollers later

#### Carthage

If you use [Carthage][] to manage your dependencies, simply add
Placeholders to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "NeedMoreDesu/Placeholder"
```

See `CarthageExample/` sample project.

Note: interface builder doesn't autocomplete Class and Module from Carthage packets as for now (4 May 2018). You need to specify both manually for it to work.

#### CocoaPods

If you use [CocoaPods][] to manage your dependencies, simply add
Placeholders to your `Podfile`:

```
pod 'Placeholders'
```

See `CocoapodsExample/` sample project.
